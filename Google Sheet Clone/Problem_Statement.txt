Google Sheet Clone

Create a spreadsheet application that emulates key features of Google Sheets, focusing on the following requirements:

1. Design a spreadsheet interface with:
   - At least 20 columns (A-T) and 30 rows
   - Column headers (A, B, C...) and row headers (1, 2, 3...)
   - A formula bar that displays and accepts formulas
   - A toolbar with basic formatting options

2. Implement cell selection and navigation:
   - Clicking a cell should highlight it and display its reference (e.g., "A1") 
   - Support keyboard navigation (Tab to move right, Enter to move down)

3. Add formula support with the following features:
   - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
   - Cell referencing (e.g., =A1+B1)
   - Range functions: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN (e.g., =SUM(A1:A5))
   - Error handling for invalid formulas

4. Include cell formatting capabilities:
   - Bold and italic text styling
   - Text and background color customization
   - Clear cell function

5. Implement data persistence:
   - Save and load spreadsheet data using localStorage
   - Auto-save when cell content changes

6. Add visual indicators for different cell types:
   - Formula cells should have distinct styling
   - Error cells should be highlighted

TAKE HOME CHALLENGE:
- Implement multi-cell selection
- Add more functions (COUNT, IF, etc.)
- Support for sorting or filtering data
- CSV import/export functionality

Your solution should work entirely in the browser without requiring a server backend.
