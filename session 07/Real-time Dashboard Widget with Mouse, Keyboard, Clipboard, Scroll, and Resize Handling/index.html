<!-- Problem Statement:
Build a real-time dashboard widget with the following features:

 - Tracks how many times a user clicks on the widget.
 - Copies the stats when user presses Ctrl + C.
 - Pressing any number key sets the "threshold" of clicks.
 - Changes background color if threshold is exceeded.
 - Widget updates its layout on window resize.
 - Logs when user scrolls to the widget section.
 - Exports a custom event thresholdReached when threshold is crossed. -->

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<!-- Instructions:
1. HTML Structure:
   - Create a dashboard widget container with appropriate HTML elements
   - Include elements to display click count and threshold
   - Add styling to make the widget visually appealing

2. JavaScript Implementation:
   - Mouse Events:
     * Add click event listener to track user clicks on the widget
     * Update and display the click count

   - Keyboard Events:
     * Listen for number key presses (0-9) to set the threshold
     * Implement Ctrl+C functionality to copy widget stats to clipboard

   - Widget Behavior:
     * Change background color when click count exceeds threshold
     * Dispatch a custom 'thresholdReached' event when threshold is crossed

   - Window Events:
     * Add resize event listener to adjust widget layout
     * Implement scroll detection to log when user scrolls to widget

3. Testing Your Solution:
   - Verify all features work as expected
   - Test edge cases (e.g., setting threshold to 0)
   - Ensure the widget is responsive on different screen sizes
